Community organisation for the development of Project FOK: a series of campaigns to facilitate the collective uptake of open access publishing

Background: see www.freeourknowledge.org/problem/

Aim: Develop a generic platform that measures the level of 'support' in the academic community for campaign(s) to boycott journals that do not conform to particular open access criteria (which can be defined separately for each campaign on the platform). E.g. one campaign will be to exclusively support journals that are compliant with the Fair Open Access principles, and another campaign will likely be to exclusively support journals that allow post-prints (or author accepted manuscripts) to be made available 'green OA' on an online repository. The idea is that each campaign will appeal to different researchers to varying degrees, depending on their career stage and research field, and provide a mechanism by which researchers can voice their commitment to publishing OA, subject to there being sufficient support from other academics in their research field. Academics will be free to sign onto any and all campaigns (using their ORCID), and when doing so will indicate the level of support at which they agree to uphold their pledge. Critically, their pledge will NOT be active, and their name will remain anonymised (or not, if they wish), until the threshold they specify is crossed. At that time, we will reveal the names of all of the pledgers who have selected that threshold, who will then collectively uphold their pledges from that day forward (thus mitigating risk to individual pledgers).
