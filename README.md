# Free Our Knowledge: Platform code repository
### Vision Statement
We're building a platform that helps researchers organise the collective uptake of mutually beneficial research practices, so that we can create positive cultural change in academia without placing individual researchers at risk.

### Project structure
Project FOK is divided into two separate repositories:
* (1) this 'platform' repository, which is for developing the code behind the [website](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/)
* (2) a ['community' repository](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community), which is for storing documents (e.g., marketing materials) and organising discussions about the project (including the design of new campaigns, using the [Issues feature](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/documentation/issues/new/choose)). Note that the project [roadmap](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) is housed over there.

### How you can support Project FOK
1. Help us by doing the following:
  * Watch/star this repository (and if interested, the [platform repository](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/platform/))
  * Join our [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/dFVBVz)
  * Log in to the [website](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) and pledge to any [campaigns](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/#campaigns) that you support
  * Follow/retweet us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projectfok) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectFOK/)  
  * Join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/free-our-knowledge-community/)
  * Share our [GofundMe campaign](gf.me/u/yvgtgg) (and donate if you can afford to :))
2. If you're a developer, take a look at the Issues in this repository to see what needs work. The [roadmap in the community repo](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) should hopefully clarify what takes priority.
3. If you're not a developer, take a look at the [readme in the community repository](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/blob/master/README.md) to see how you can help :)
