# platform code
### Vision Statement
We're working with researchers and developers to build a 'crowdacting' platform so that researchers can organise collective action in the pursuit of progressive, inclusive, and supportive cultural norms in academia.

### Purpose of this repository
This is the open source repository for building the [Free Our Knowledge platform](https://www.freeourknowledge.org). Note that all discussion and documents related to the project, including discussion of campaign ideas, is hosted separately [here](). This repo is just for code.
