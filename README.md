# FOK platform code
### Vision Statement
We're building a platform that helps researchers organise the collective uptake of mutually beneficial research practices, so that we can create positive cultural change in academia without placing vulnerable individuals at risk.

### Purpose of this repository
This is the open source repository for building the [Free Our Knowledge platform](https://www.freeourknowledge.org). Note that all discussion and documents related to the project, including discussion of campaign ideas, is hosted separately [here](). This repo is just for code.
